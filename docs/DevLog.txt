    App Icons
    • Source: Feather Icons (https://feathericons.com)
    • For a moment, it looked like 2020 Chris' decision not to document
      where these icons came from was going to make finding the source
      impossible. Lucky for 2023 me, I never deleted the .svg fies from
      my laptop and was able to google the vector source class strings
      until I found a match. I'm so glad I created this document.

    AlertDialog Emulator Issues
    • AlertDialogs are meant to dim the entire screen behind them when
      shown. This doesn't happen on the emulator, leading me to believe
      the default UI behavior must have changed in newer versions of
      Android. After wasting an entire night trying various layout,
      style, and drawable configurations, it turns out my code was fine.
      The issue is that the "Disable HW overlays" needs to be toggled
      on in the Hardware Accelerated Rendering section of the emulated
      device settings.
