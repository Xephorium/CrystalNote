    App Icons
    • Source: Feather Icons (https://feathericons.com)
    • For a moment, it looked like 2020 Chris' decision not to document
      where these icons came from was going to make finding the source
      impossible. Lucky for 2023 me, I never deleted the .svg fies from
      my laptop and was able to google the vector source class strings
      until I found a match. I'm so glad I created this document.

    AlertDialog Emulator Issues
    • AlertDialogs are meant to dim the entire screen behind them when
      shown. This doesn't happen on the emulator, leading me to believe
      the default UI behavior must have changed in newer versions of
      Android. After wasting an entire night trying various layout,
      style, and drawable configurations, it turns out my code was fine.
      The issue is that the "Disable HW overlays" needs to be toggled
      on in the Hardware Accelerated Rendering section of the emulated
      device settings.

    Editing Plaintext Files Opened From an External App
    • Storage access permissions for Android API > 29 make editing files
      opened from any external app (like File Manager) a prohibitively
      clunky user experience. Since it's a comparatively minor feature,
      I've simply disabled external plaintext file editing on newer
      versions of Android.
    • The problem is the access level granted by File Manager's intent.
      The intent only provides view access to the URI it passes, which
      is how CrystalNote is able to open and display a plaintext file's
      contents. However, write access to that same file is not permitted.
      From what I can tell, Google's new storage paradigm doesn't allow
      any method of asking the user for write access to the file beyond
      simply opening a file browser for them to select the document they
      want to edit. For reference, this would be done by creating and
      firing a ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT intent:

        val intent = Intent(Intent.ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT).apply {
            addCategory(Intent.CATEGORY_OPENABLE)
            type = "text/plain"
            putExtra(DocumentsContract.EXTRA_INITIAL_URI, fileUri)
        }
        startActivityForResult(intent, ACTIVITY_FOR_RESULT_CODE)

    • This works, but the user experience is a mess. The entire process:

        1. User opens File Manager app. Browses to text file. Taps.
        2. User selects CrystalNote from list of apps.
        3. File is open for viewing in CrystalNote. Cannot be edited.
        4. User taps more menu. Selects "Edit File".
        5. Dialog is shown explaining that user will need to reopen
           the file. User taps continue. System file browser shown.
        6. User finds and taps the file they've already opened one
           more time. File opens in CrystalNote, now in edit mode.
        7. User can finally edit the file.

    • If the user has to go to this much trouble, they might as well
      just import the note, edit it, and export a new text file. Maybe
      I'll change my mind later. But for now, it isn't worth the hassle.
